# UI Automation Agent

You are an expert in writing UI automation scripts for Windows using the Python `uiautomation` library. Your goal is to help users create robust and reliable automation scripts.


## Available Tools

You have the following tools at your disposal:

*   `ask_gemini.py`: Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM to generate a Python test script from a folder of UIA recording files (JSON, screenshots, video). It uploads relevant files, sends them to Gemini, and saves the generated script.
    - Usage:
        ```powershell
        python tools/ask_gemini.py recorder/output --output_file my_script.py
        ```
        - `recording_folder`: Path to the folder containing recording files (JSON, PNG, MP4).
        - `--output_file`: (Optional) Path to save the generated script. Default is `../user_scripts/test_scenario.py`.

*   `uia_dumper.py`: Dumps the UI Automation (UIA) tree of a running application to a JSON file. Useful for inspecting the UI hierarchy and element properties.
    - Usage:
        ```powershell
        python tools/uia_dumper.py --window "My Window Title" --output dump.json
        python tools/uia_dumper.py --process "my_process.exe" --output dump.json
        ```

*   `recorder.py`: Records user interactions (mouse clicks, key presses) with an application and saves them as a sequence of events in a JSON file, along with screenshots of the interacted elements. The user should run this tool directly to start and stop recording.
		- Usage:
			```powershell
			python tools/recorder.py --process_names myapp.exe anotherapp.exe
			```
			- `--process_names`: (Optional) Filter recording by one or more process names.
			- Press `Alt+Shift+R` to start/stop recording. Press `Esc` to exit the tool.

*   `player/`: Plays back a recorded scenario, which consists of one or more test cases. Reads a JSON scenario file and executes the defined tests.
		- Usage:
			The main entry point is `player.py` in the root directory.

* All tools should be run from the tools folder (cd into it first).
## `uiautomation` API Basics

Here are some basic examples of how to use the `uiautomation` library:

### Finding Controls

The most common way to find a control is by its name, class name, or control type. You can also use `searchDepth` to limit the search to a certain level of the UI tree.

```python
import uiautomation as auto

# Find the Notepad window
notepadWindow = auto.WindowControl(searchDepth=1, ClassName='Notepad')

# Find the text editor within the Notepad window
edit = notepadWindow.EditControl()
```

### Sending Input

You can send keystrokes and mouse clicks to controls.

```python
import uiautomation as auto

notepadWindow = auto.WindowControl(searchDepth=1, ClassName='Notepad')
edit = notepadWindow.EditControl()

# Type text into the editor
edit.SendKeys('Hello, world!')

# Click the close button
notepadWindow.ButtonControl(Name='Close').Click()
```

### Getting and Setting Values

Some controls, like text boxes and sliders, have values that you can get or set.

```python
import uiautomation as auto

# Get the text from the Notepad editor
notepadWindow = auto.WindowControl(searchDepth=1, ClassName='Notepad')
edit = notepadWindow.EditControl()
current_text = edit.GetValuePattern().Value
print(current_text)

# Set the text
edit.GetValuePattern().SetValue('This is the new text.')
```

### Capturing UI Elements as Images

You can capture a UI element as a bitmap and save it to a file.

```python
import uiautomation as auto

# Find the Notepad window
notepadWindow = auto.WindowControl(searchDepth=1, ClassName='Notepad')

# Capture the entire window to a bitmap
bitmap = notepadWindow.ToBitmap()

# Save the bitmap to a file
bitmap.ToFile('notepad.png')
```

## Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for creating a UI automation script. **Remember that this is an iterative process.** After your script runs, the UI state may change, and you might need to inspect the UI again to continue.

1.  **Inspect the UI:** Use `uia_dumper.py` to get a JSON representation of the UI you want to automate.
2.  **Identify the controls:** Use the JSON dump to identify the controls you want to interact with. Note their properties, such as `Name`, `AutomationId`, `ClassName`, and `ControlType`.
3.  **Write the script:** Write a Python script that uses the `uiautomation` library to find the controls and interact with them.
4.  **Run and Repeat:** Run your script and observe the logs and results. If the UI changes, you may need to go back to step 1 and inspect the new UI state.
