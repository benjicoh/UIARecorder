# Developer Notes

This file contains some developer notes and clarifications about the project architecture.

## The `tools` Directory

A previous note questioned the necessity of the `tools` directory. After a thorough review, it's clear that the `tools` directory is an essential and integral part of this project. It is organized into three main components:

- **`tools/recorder`**: This tool is responsible for recording user interactions with a UI. It captures mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and video, and it logs detailed information about the UI elements involved. The output of this tool is the primary input for the agent.

- **`tools/player`**: This tool is used to play back automated test scripts. It can execute single test scripts or complex scenarios defined in a JSON file. The scripts generated by the agent are designed to be run by this player.

- **`tools/common`**: This directory contains shared modules, such as logging and UI Automation utilities, that are used by both the recorder, the player, and the agent.

The agent (`gemini_flow.py`) itself relies on the `tools` for its operation, specifically `tools/common/logger.py` and `agent/uia_dumper.py` (which in turn uses `tools/common/uia.py`). Therefore, removing the `tools` directory would break the entire system.
