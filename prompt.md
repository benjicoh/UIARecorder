## Goal
- Generate a robust windows desktop automation script using python [uiautomation package](https://github.com/yinkaisheng/Python-UIAutomation-for-Windows).

## UIA Documentation
For more details on UI Automation elements and patterns, refer to the official Microsoft documentation:
- [AutomationElement Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.automation.automationelement?view=windowsdesktop-9.0)
- [UI Automation Control Patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns)

## Inputs
- A video file with narration of the test scenario.
- A json file with the UIA properties of the clicked and focused elements.
- A series of screenshots for each user interaction, with annotations.

## JSON Format
The JSON file contains a list of events, each with the following structure:
```json
{
    "timestamp": 12.345,
    "event_type": "mouse_click",
    "event_data": { ... },
    "element_hierarchy": [
        {
            "id": "element-1",
            "name": "Button",
            "class_name": "Button",
            "control_type": "ButtonControl",
            "patterns": { ... },
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
- Each element in the `element_hierarchy` has a unique `id`.
- The `patterns` object lists all the UI Automation patterns supported by the element. Refer to this to understand the available actions for an element (e.g., `InvokePattern`, `ValuePattern`).

## Element Screenshots
For each new UI element detected in the hierarchy, a screenshot of that element is captured and saved in the `recording/images` folder.
- The screenshot is taken of the element's bounding rectangle.
- Screenshots are only taken for elements that are on-screen and have a valid, non-zero rectangle.
- The filename for each screenshot is in the format `{element_id}_ss_{timestamp}.png`, where the timestamp is the number of seconds from the start of the recording.

## Guidelines
- The script should be robust and able to handle various UI scenarios.
- Pay close attention to the element hierarchy and control properties defined in the JSON file. Correctly identify the elements based on that.
- **Refer to the `patterns` in the JSON to determine the available interfaces and actions for each element.**
- If ambiguity arises in identifying elements, consider using additional properties or a combination of properties to disambiguate.
- Use appropriate error handling to manage unexpected UI states.
- Include comments in the code to explain the logic and flow.
- Provide logging of your actions and any errors encountered.
